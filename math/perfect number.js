Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.
function is_perfect(number)
{
var temp = 0;
   for(var i=1;i<=number/2;i++)
     {
         if(number%i === 0)
          {
            temp += i;
          }
     }
   
     if(temp === number && temp !== 0)
        {
       console.log("It is a perfect number.");
        } 
     else
        {
       console.log("It is not a perfect number.");
        }   
 }
